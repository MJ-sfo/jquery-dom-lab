#### jQuery Selector Challenge - [solutions](solutions.md)

Use jquery to select the element containing the words "Hello There" with as many different selectors as you can think of:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Ex 1</title>
</head>
<body>
   <div id="greeting">Hello There</div>
</body>
</html>
```

1. *Get* the value "Hello There".
2. Change (or *set*) the value to "Hola".
3. Add an h1 to the page that says "A Spanish Greeting".
4. Add a second greeting ("Que tal?"), below the first.
5. Add the class "blue" to both greetings.
