## jQuery Selector Challenge - [solutions](solutions.md)

To get started, clone this repo.

Open `index.html`. In your Chrome Javascript Console, use jquery to select the element containing the words "Hello There" with as many different selectors as you can think of:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <div id="greeting">Hello There</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```
Also in your Chrome Javascript Console, try the following challenges:

1. *Get* the value "Hello There".
2. Change (or *set*) the value to "Hola".
3. Add an h1 to the page that says "A Spanish Greeting".
4. Add a second greeting ("Que tal?"), in a second column to the right of the first.
5. Add the class "blue" to both greetings.


For each problem above, copy your solution into [`/scripts/app.js`](/scripts/app.js) on the correct line.

When you open `index.html` in your browser, your solutions should all run!
